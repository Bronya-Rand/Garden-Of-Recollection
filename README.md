# The Garden of Recollection

The Garden of Recollection is an extension for SillyTavern that allows users to visit past chats with characters they haven't interacted with in a while as well as create new ones with said characters.

## Why the name?
> Black Swan: Through the course of one's existence, only a scant amount of impactful memoriesâ€” pain, joy, rage, sorrow, can be harvested... The Garden of Recollection was conceived with the preservation of such memories in mind. To hear one's speech, to venture into their hearts, to glimpse through memories...

## Features
1. Weighted Random Selection: Compared to SillyTavern's default `/random` command, The Garden of Recollection uses a weighted random selection based on the amount of randomness you decide to use. The Garden of Recollection will select a character or group chat based on the randomness you set with lower randomness resulting in older or never used characters being selected and higher randomness resulting in a normal random selection.

2. New Random Chats: The Garden of Recollection allows you to create new random chats with characters based on the randomness you set. This means that you can create new chats with characters you haven't interacted with in a while or even never interacted with before.

3. Random Group Chat Support: The Garden of Recollection supports random group chats, allowing for older group chats to be selected based on the randomness you set. This means that you can revisit group chats and interact with characters you haven't spoken in that chat in a while.
